# Example Page

This is a simple example page using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for static site generation. You can use it to host your site on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) or run it locally for development.
  
This example also uses [rafgraph/spa-github-pages](https://github.com/rafgraph/spa-github-pages) to support client-side routing on GitHub Pages. The `404.html` file is configured to redirect all requests to your `index.html`, enabling single-page application (SPA) behavior.

## Usage

- To run locally:  
    ```sh
    bundle exec jekyll serve
    ``` 

- To deploy on GitHub Pages:  
    Push your repository to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
